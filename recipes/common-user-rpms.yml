remove:
  # example: removing firefox (in favor of the flatpak)
  # "firefox" is the main package, "firefox-langpacks" is a dependency
  # - firefox
  # - firefox-langpacks # also remove firefox dependency (not required for all packages, this is a special case)
  - firefox # default firefox removed in favor of flatpak
  - firefox-langpacks # langpacks needs to also be removed to prevent dependency problems
